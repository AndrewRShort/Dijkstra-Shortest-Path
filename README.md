Dijkstra Shortest Path: Jack source code. 

The Jack compiler is created by you when you take the Coursera 2 part course called "nand2tetris".  You then use your own Jack compiler to compile this folder of .jack files into .vm files. Then you load the folder into the supplied VM emulator and run the program.   (You can also use the supplied Jack Compiler, but it's more fun to use your own Jack compiler).
